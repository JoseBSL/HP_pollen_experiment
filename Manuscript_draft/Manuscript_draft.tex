Pollinator sharing can have negative consequences for plant fitness with
the arrival of foreign pollen. However, the costs of heterospecific
pollen are not yet well understood. We conducted a glasshouse experiment
to understand how phylogenetic relatedness and plant traits mediate the
impacts of heterospecific pollen transfer. We conducted 4XXXX crosses by
experimentally transferring pollen (50\% and 100\% ratio) with
reciporcal crosses between 10 species belonging to three different
families: Brassicaceae, Solanaceae and Convolvulaceae. Seed set was used
as proxy of plant fitness. We found that for 65\% of the treatments with
50\% mix reduced seed set. Moreover, the reduction in seed set was
dependent on the degree of relatedness and reproductive traits of the
pollen recipient and not the pollen donor. Our results show that certain
traits, particularly compatibility system, are critical in understanding
the costs of heterospecific pollen. \vspace{3mm}\hrule

\emph{Keywords}: heterospecific pollen, plant reproduction, fitness,
interspecific competition, phylogenetic distance.

\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{introduction}

\textbf{Paragraph 1} General idea to our concept

In most ecosystems, plant species normally coexist and share their
floral visitors with other species Bascompte et al. (2003). From the
plants' perspective, this pollinator sharing can be positive due to
facilitation Carvalheiro et al. (2014) or negative due to competition at
the pre-pollination stage Pauw (2013). An increasing number of visits
often correlates with higher chances of fertilization Engel and Irwin
(2003). However this is not always the case, among these possible flower
visitors there are also nectar robbers and pollen thieves Inouye (1980).
Receiving both sufficient quantity and quality deposited on the stigma
is thus highly relevant to the pollination success of the plant Aizen
and Harder (2007).

\textbf{Paragraph 2} Introducing topic and knowledge gap

By visiting many plant species, many pollinators are responsible for
conspecific pollen loss and the transport of foreign pollen, both of
which can have important detrimental effects on species fitness Morales
and Traveset (2008); Ashman and Arceo-Gómez (2013); Arceo-Gómez and
Ashman (2016). Foreign pollen arrival can play an important role in
plant species fitness but outcomes are variable and appear to be context
dependent as there is not always a decrease in fitness Morales and
Traveset (2008). Some of this variation is likely due to the enormous
variability of foreign pollen transferred across systems ranging from
between 0 and 75 percent but most studies report ranges of
heterospecific pollen between 0 and 20 percent of the total pollen load
Bartomeus et al. (2008) Montgomery and Rathcke (2012); Ashman and
Arceo-Gómez (2013); Fang and Huang (2013), yet even these relatively low
amounts of heterospecific pollen transferred can decrease fitness
greatly Thomson et al. (1982). While we now have some understanding of
the impacts of heterospecific pollen quantity, we have less
understanding of other factors that could be driving the variation in
impacts upon fitness. Ashman and Arceo-Gómez (2013) postulated the first
predictive framework that identifies a need to understand how plant
traits might mediate heterospecific pollen effect, whereby mating system
and pollen size were predicted to potentially mediate the impact of
foreign pollen transfer on plant fitness. This concept is supported by
other studies, such as Tong and Huang (2016) that demonstrate an
asymmetrical effect in 6 species of \emph{Pedicularis} whereby the
pollen of long styled species was able to grow the full length of the
style on short styled species but not vice versa. While this suggests
that the impacts of heterospecific pollen may differ among pollen donor
and recipient, few studies have been conducted to ascertain whether this
pattern is in fact a trend or to identify the extent to which other
plant traits are critical to heterospecific pollen impacts.

\textbf{Paragraph 3} Expanding ideas with examples

Given the large variability in mating systems across populations
Whitehead et al. (2018), it is difficult to determine potential impacts
upon HP transfer yet incompatibility system is another plant trait that
appears to play an important role in foreign pollen effect whereby
species that are self incompatible have stronger barriers to
heterospecific pollen than self-compatible species Ashman and
Arceo-Gómez (2013). The type of incompatibility, (i.e.~whether
sporophytic or gametophytic) is related to the location of pollen
recognition; sporophytic incompatibility relates to signaling at the
stigma surface while gametophytic occurs within the style Barrett
(1988). This later acting pollen recognition mechanism is associated
with greater negative effect than sporophytic recognistion Ashman and
Arceo-Gómez (2013). Nonetheless, an effect of foreign pollen is a bit
obscured by the variability within species, however species that are
strong selfers or strong outcrossers have less variablity in mating
systems and predictions of effect could be more realistic (see figure 1
from Whitehead et al. (2018)). Moreover, other traits such as number of
pollen grains per flower and number of ovules have been traditionally
associated with the type of incompatibility system where species with
higher pollen ovule ratios are predicted to be xenogamous and species
with low pollen ovule ratios autogamous (REF). Selfer species are known
to have a reduction of herkogamy (REF) and less pollen production per
ovule (REF) which can be interpretated as a reduction of pollen exported
into the community. Other morphological traits, like stigma size can be
determinant for the total pollen quatity that a stigma can receive and
therefore related to do that pollen size would also play an important
role. Example with pollen here.

\href{Jose}{This last bit of the paragraph is still under development}

\textbf{Paragraph 4} Maybe connect with paragrph above?

\href{Romina}{Comments on it}

Species with similar traits are more closely related XXXXXXXXX. (Refs?
Brown and Mitchell (2001) Arceo-Gómez et al. (2016) Tong and Huang
(2016) ). Several studies predict that the impact of HP transfer is
likely to be greater for closely related species (Ashman and Arceo-Gómez
(2013)). Few studies however, have focused on the impacts of
heterospecific pollen of distantly related species Thomson et al. (1982)
Galen and Gregory (1989) Neiland and Wilcock (1999). Yet, most insects
and most stigmas have been found to carry multiple species of foreign
pollen with little attention to degree of relatedness (Arceo-Gómez and
Ashman (2016); Fang and Huang (2013) ; also cite studies from pollen
transfer networks here such as\ldots{} ). Further, a majority of plant
species are generalist and thus receive visits from multiple different
pollinators. Given these are generally the ones that receive greater
loads of heterospecific pollen Fang and Huang (2013) and unrelated
species are more likely to coexist with other species due to less niche
overlap (Ref), understanding the role of foreign pollen from distantly
related species thus deserves greater attention in understanding
coexistence blah blahXXXXX refs.. Notwithstanding, the effect of
heterospecific pollen of far and close related species at community
level remains to be explored beyond single pairwise interactions.

\textbf{Paragraph 5} Introducing our experiment

In this study we investigated how floral reproductive traits and
relatedness mediate the impact of HP transfer by asking the following
research questions : To what extent do (i) floral reproductive traits
and (ii) relatedness, mediate the impacts of heterospecific pollen on
seed set. We do this by creating an artificial co-flowering community
with 10 species belonging to three different families with different
traits.

\section{METHODS}\label{methods}

The study was conducted in a glasshouse at University of New England
(Armidale, Australia) from November 2017 to March 2018. Rooms were
temperature controlled depending on the requirements of the species with
day and night temperature differences. The species selected
(\textbf{Table 1}) belonged to three different families, Solanaceae,
Brassicaceae and Convolvulaceae. The criteria of species/family
selection was based on close/distant related species (see phylogenetic
tree for relatedness fig 1), heterogeneous traits, low structural flower
complexity and fast life cycle. For the purpose of the experiment all
the species where considered as pollen recipient and as pollen donor
(see interaction matrix, fig 2). Species were watered once or twice per
day and fertilized weekly (NPK 23: 3.95: 14).

\textbf{Hand-pollination}

Foreign pollen effect was studied through two different treatments, one
with 50\% conspecific pollen and 50\% heterospecific pollen and a second
one with 100\% foreign pollen (N=10). Therefore, 180 different
combinations were perform with N=10. Seed set was the proxy of effect
for all our treatments. Moreover, hand cross pollination, hand self
pollination, apomixis (bagged emasculated flowers) and natural selfing
were tested for each species (N=10). Flowers were emasculated the day
prior anthesis and hand pollinated next day with a toothpick.
Hand-pollination was conducted with 3-4 gentle touches on the stigma
surface. The mixes of pollen were realized on an eppendorf based on the
pollen counts maded with Neubaeur chamber (each anther was counted 4
times for 20 different anthers per species). In order to confirm that
the treatments applied were 50-50 percent pollen, for each focal species
the total stigmatic load of pollen was counted from one donor of each
family (N=3).

\textbf{Traits and evolutive distance}

The traits measured for each species were pollen per anther, number of
ovules, stigma width and length and stigmatic area, style width and
length, ovary width and length. Moreover stigma type was tested. Pollen
was counted for 20 anthers of each species with 4 replicates per sample
with an hemocytometer. Previously anthers were squashed on a known
solution with the pippete tip and homogeneize with a vortex for 30
seconds. Ovule number was counted with the help of an stereomicroscope
and a small grid over a petri dish from 15 randomly selected flowers.
The different morphometrical traits were measured with a digital
stereomicrospe. Levels of self incompatibility were estimated by
dividing the the fruit set of hand self pollination by hand cross
pollination Lloyd and Schoen (1992).

\textbf{Analysis}

We used the statistical language \texttt{R} (R Core Team 2018) for all
our analyses. Differences of seed set between treatments and hand cross
pollination for each species was tested through mixed linear models. For
the following analysis we scaled the values of seed production for all
the species with mean 0 and sd of 1. To test the effect of
heterospecific pollen, we substracted to the seed set of hand cross
pollination the seed set of heterospecific pollen treatments. In order
to see correlations between heterospecific pollen effect and traits we
performed Mantel test between the matrix of heterospecific pollen effect
and the distance matrix of each trait (euclidean distances). Moreover,
Mantel test was also conducted between heterospecific pollen effect and
the square root of the matrix of phylogenetic distance due to
improvement in the statistical power (Letten \& Cornwell 2014). We
explored also the the relations between traits and heterospecific pollen
effect through generalized mixed models where the response variable was
heterospecific pollen effect, the independent variable the different
traits and the random effects the different treatments per species.
Moreover, pairwise evolutive distances were calculated with MEGA7 for
two kinds of markers: 1) Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 2)
ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (RBCL). The sequences of interest were
downloaded from NCBI GenBank and the phylogenetic tree constructed by
maximum likelihood with MEGA7.

\section{RESULTS}\label{results}

Results of hand cross pollination, self hand pollination, natural
selfing and apomixis are presented in \textbf{Table 2}. Heterospecific
pollen reduced seet set signifcatively with the 50-50\% heterospecific
pollen treatments for 65\% of the pairwise interactions
p\textless{}0.05. Across families we found a very similar effect but
when species where look at species level they respond differently even
within the same family, for instance for two species of the Brassicaceae
family \emph{Brassica oleracea} and \emph{Eruca versicaria} we found
very contrasting effects of foreign pollen where for the first one, all
donors reduce seed set significatively and for the second, just two
species did out of nine. The 100\% foreign pollen treatments barely
produced seeds or fruits and just for \emph{Sinapis alba} we did not
find significant differences between the hand cross pollination and one
treatment with pollen from a confamilial. Solanaceae species with berry
fruit type developed small fruits or even normal fruits in some cases.
\emph{S. lycopersicum} seems to produced small fruits (35\% of the
treatments) independently of pollen and pollen donor due to also
apomictic treatments did, never normal size. \emph{C. annuum} produced
some fruits (9\%) of both small and normal size and finally \emph{S.
melongena} produced seedless normal fruits with just confamilial pollen
(3\%), for both species seems that fruit formation was induced by pollen
on the stigma because of lack of fruit production with treatments that
tested for apomixis.

Mantel test indicates that a possible correlation exist between
heterospecific pollen effect and the evolutive distances, for ITS and
RBCL markers we had r coefficients of 0.29 and 0.25 respectively
p\textless{}0.05. Moreover, Mantel test indicates that also a possible
correlation between stigma width and stigma type exist. Trait
correlations were also explored with GLMM

\section{DISCUSSION}\label{discussion}

Discussion

What are the implications of the findings?

Other idea based on the paper of Aizen 2007:

He explains seed set in this way. O total number of ovules, d fraction
of ovules that become seed set, b proportion of pollen grains that reach
ovules, p number of pollen grains.

\(S=dO(1-e^bp)\)

\(S=dO(1-e^bp(HpEffect))\)

but this Hp effect maybe can be divided at the same time in the
interaction between recipient-donor with the main traits that drive the
effect. Moreover, this should consider quantity of hp. lINEAR EFFECT?
How to model this maybe talk with nacho.

Ideas about pollen size in heterospecific pollen effect. (still have to
develop it more\ldots{})

Let's classify pollen size in three groups in order to understand the
interaction between pollen donor and recipient: 1) Donor pollen size
\textless{} Recipient pollen size 2) Donor pollen size = Recipient
pollen size 3) Donor pollen size \textgreater{} Recipient pollen size

Now I try to develop each part

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Donor pollen size \textless{} Recipient pollen size
\end{enumerate}

Effect:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Donor's pollen could clogg the stigma
\item
  Chemical inhibition
\end{itemize}

Traits associated with bigger pollen of the recipient:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recipient's pollen have faster pollen tube growth (example with my
  data)
\item
  Reduction in number of ovules (Also with my species)
\item
  Big differences in pollen size can be traduced in low relatednes
  therefore less likely of pollen germination on a far related stigma.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Donor pollen size = Recipient pollen size
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Very relatedness dependant this point
\item
  Similar probabilities of taken space on the stigma
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Donor pollen size \textgreater{} Recipient pollen size
\end{enumerate}

Effect:

-In small stigmas big pollen grains can occupy great part of the
stigmatic area.

-small pollen grains can get embeded
