\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{introduction}

\textbf{Paragraph 1}

In natural systems plant species normally coexist and share their floral
visitors with other species Bascompte et al. (2003). This pollinator
sharing from the plant perspective at the pre-pollination stage can be
negative due to competition Pauw (2013) or positive due to facilitation
Carvalheiro et al. (2014). Once, the floral visitor has arrived to the
flower, pollen deposition on the stigma can take place and therefore
ovule fertilization. An increasing number of visits generally correlates
with higher chances of fertilization (Refs). However this is not always
the case, among these flower visitors we find also nectar robbers and
pollen thiefs (Refs) or pollen quality (example with ref?). Moreover,
other less studies issues in the pollination process such as conspecific
pollen loss or the arrival of foreign pollen can have detrimental
effects for the species fitness Morales and Traveset (2008).

\textbf{Paragraph 2}

The effect of heterospecific pollen has been widely studied (Morales \&
Traveset 2008). Invasive species are supposed to have greater negative
effect than native ones Arceo-Gómez and Ashman (2016). Although when
non-natives species don´t have greater negative effect we still don´t
know why. For this reason, this ecological question is non a native non
native one is a trait based issue that is still to be solved. Moreover,
the quantity of pollen that integrates in the network can be quite
variable ranging from low quatities Bartomeus et al. (2008) to
intermediate (ref) to high (ref). Moreover, closely related species are
supposed to reduce fitness in greater effect but the evidence is scarce
and based on independent studies with different methodologies
(Arceo-gomez \& Ashman 2016) or studies that just check it with a pair
of species that are highly related with the aim to understand
hybridization costs (refs). There is a need to deepen into how
relatednes is involve in the costs of heterospecific pollen effect.
Furthermore, following the conceptual trait framework of Ashman and
Arceo-Gomez on heterospecific pollen there are good theoretical basis
for trait effect. Notwithstanding, non empirical work has tested how
really these traits are involved in heterospecific pollen effect.

Explain traits. Put examples

\textbf{Paragraph 3}

\textbf{Paragraph 4}

The great difficulty of working with pollen in a coflowering community
make the understanding of heterospecifc pollen effect a real challenge.
For this reason we have created an artificial co-flowering community in
a glasshouse to test the effect with all the possible combinations among
them. Where we test the folowing hypothesis: 1) Does heterospecific
pollen reduce seed set, if so, 2) Does heterospecific pollen effect
depend on the relatedness of the species, 3) Does heterospecific pollen
effect depend on any floral trait?

\section{METHODS}\label{methods}

\href{}{comment starts} Glasshouse trial • Species selected and why --
how you made them co-flower • Give details of sources and planting
seeds, growth medium in pots, temperature and light details • Hand
crosses and how you did them, how you measured seed set over time. •
Analyses of data -- standardization, means, matrices etc.

• Analyses and technical difficulties: We calculated effect size by
subtracting the mean of the cross pollinated seed set by the mean effect
of the HP pollen (explain exactly what figures you used to calculate
this) -- check with liam about potentially using missing values analyses
for the species we don't have?

Check that the method is working well to prove that your crosses were
close to 50\% results in SI i.e not all mixes were 50/50\% and we have
now counted all the pollen to make this a quantitative variable. We also
need to factor in the point that we have different total abundances of
pollen across our treatments, irrespective of ratios. To what extent are
differences in the ratios of pollen applied by hand across different
plant families influenced by plant traits such as pollen size,
morphology and stigma surface type?

Results -- may need to include amount of pollen in models as random
factor- prefill matrix with missing value analyse for the species you
don't have.\\
Question 1: how do different pollination treatments (100\% HP, 50\% HP,
self and cross ) impact HP pollen across different plant families? Even
with 100\% HP one (or more species?) still produced seed set.

Result Effect size of Seed set \textasciitilde{} phylogenetic distance
relationship We found that the variation ?/ mean effect size of seed set
is positively related to phylogenetic distance. This means the more
unrelated the species are, the greater the negative impact of
heterospecific pollen (give stats effect size i.e.~Procrustes, X = 0.35;
P = 0.03)

Question 2 : what are the main traits impacting HP impacts?
(compatibility system, pollen size, stigma surface, wet/dry stigma,
length of style etc.

Effect size of seed set \textasciitilde{} floral traits/ reproductive
plant traits We found that the three best terms to explain the variation
in seed set is pollen/ovule ratio, stigma width and style length (Stats
effect size i.e.~X = 0.39, P = 0.02).\\
Need to provide correlation matrix for all traits just for 10 species
Show both ways to present this. Which particular traits do you find
significant effects for? Show this and give stats. Present plot for each
trait and effect size

\href{}{comment finishes}

The study was conducted in a glasshouse at University of New England
(Armidale, Australia) from November 2017 to March 2018. Rooms were
temperature controlled depending on the requirements of the species with
day and night temperature differences. The species selected (Table 1)
belonged to three different families, Solanaceae, Brassicaceae and
Convolvulaceae. The criteria of species/family selection was based on
close/distant related species (see phylogenetic tree for relatedness fig
1), heterogeneous traits, low structural flower complexity and fast life
cycle. For the purpose of the experiment all the species where
considered as pollen recipient and as pollen donor (see interaction
matrix, fig 2). Species were watered once or twice per day and
fertilized weekly (NPK 23: 3.95: 14).

Brown and Mitchell 2001 could be a good paper to explain why we pick
seed set as a proxy and not fruit set. We cannot see changes on it,
losing information with it.

\textbf{Hand-pollination}

Foreign pollen effect was studied through two different treatments, one
with 50\% conspecific pollen and 50\% heterospecific pollen and a second
one with 100\% foreign pollen (N=10). Seed set was the proxy of effect
(see Brown and Mitchell 2001, for differences in effect between seed set
and fruit set) and ``pollen tubes''. Moreover, hand cross pollination,
hand self pollination, apomixis (bagged emasculated flowers) and natural
selfing were tested (N=10). Flowers were emasculated the day prior
anthesis and hand pollinated next day with a toothpick. Had-pollination
was realized with 3-4 gentle touches on the surface of the stigma. The
mixes of pollen were performed on an eppendorf based on the pollen
counts maded with Neubaeur chamber (each anther was counted 4 times for
20 different anthers per species).

\textbf{Evolutive distance}

Two types of evolutive distances were calculated with MEGA7 thow kinds
of markers: 1) Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 2)
ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (RBCL)

\textbf{Traits}

Several traits of the ten species were measured. Pollen per anther was
counted, number of ovules, stigma width and length and stigmatic area,
style width and length, ovary width and length. Moreover stigma type was
tested. Self-incompatibility was

We used the statistical language \texttt{R} (R Core Team 2018) for all
our analyses. These were implemented in dynamic rmarkdown documents
using \texttt{knitr} (Xie 2014, 2015, 2018) and \texttt{rmarkdown}
(Allaire et al. 2018) packages. All the multilevel models were fitted
with \texttt{lme4} (Bates et al. 2015).
