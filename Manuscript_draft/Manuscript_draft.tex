Pollinator sharing can have negative consequences for species fitness
with the arrival of foreign pollen. However, the costs of heterospecific
pollen are not yet well understood. For this reason, we have conducted a
glasshouse experiment where we try to understand how phylogenetic
relatedness and the different traits of these species are involved in
this process. We experimentally crossed 10 species belonging to three
different families: Brassicaceae, Solanaceae and Convolvulaceae.
Overall, more than 4000 crosses were done and seed set and pollen tubes
were considered as proxy of effect. We found that for all species
foreign pollen (50\% or less) reduced seed set. Moreover, the seed set
reduction is not dependent on the degree of relatedness of the pollen
donor. However, the effect is governed by the degree of relatedness and
the traits of the species recipient. Our results show that the outcome
of heterospecific pollen deposition is determined in greater degree by
the traits of the pollen recipient than the pollen donor and that
certain traits such as compatibility system are crucial to understand
the costs of heterospecific pollen.

\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{introduction}

\textbf{Paragraph 1} General idea to our concept

In natural systems plant species normally coexist and share their floral
visitors with other species Bascompte et al. (2003). This pollinator
sharing from the plant perspective at the pre-pollination stage can be
negative due to competition Pauw (2013) or positive due to facilitation
Carvalheiro et al. (2014). Once the floral visitor has arrived to the
flower, pollen deposition on the stigma can take place and hence ovule
fertilization. An increasing number of visits generally correlates with
higher chances of fertilization Engel and Irwin (2003). However this is
not always the case, among these possible flower visitors we find also
nectar robbers and pollen thiefs Inouye (1980) and the quality of pollen
that is deposit on the stigma is also highly relevant to the pollination
succes Aizen and Harder (2007). Moreover, other less study issues in the
pollination process are conspecific pollen loss and the arrival of
foreign pollen which can have important detrimental effects on species
fitness Morales and Traveset (2008) Ashman and Arceo-Gómez (2013).

\textbf{Paragraph 2} Introducing topic and knowledge gap

Recent studies have advanced in the ecological understanding of
heterospecific pollen effect Morales and Traveset (2008) Ashman and
Arceo-Gómez (2013) Arceo-Gómez and Ashman (2016). A general overview of
foreign pollen arrival is that it can play an important role on species
fitness but seems to be context dependent and not always produce a
decrease in fitness Morales and Traveset (2008). Part of this
unpredictability is due to the enormous variability of foreing pollen
transferred in nature, where levels between 0 and 75 percent are seen,
but most commonly values ranges between 0 and 20 percent of the total
pollen load Bartomeus et al. (2008) Montgomery and Rathcke (2012) Ashman
and Arceo-Gómez (2013) Fang and Huang (2013), being the generalist
species the ones that receive greater loads of heterospecific pollen
Fang and Huang (2013). Surprisingly, this low ranges of heterospecific
pollen have been shown to decrease fitness greatly Thomson et al.
(1982). Although heterospecific pollen quantity is fundamental to
understand the outcome of the interaction so is the different traits of
both pollen donor and recipient. Ashman and Arceo-Gómez (2013)
postulated the first predictive framework for traits of heterospecific
pollen effect, where different traits such as compatibility system and
pollen size among others seems to be crucial to understand foreing
pollen effect. Moreover, in Tong and Huang (2016) an assymetric effect
was shown in a crossing experiment between 6 species of the genus
\emph{Pedicularis} where the pollen of long styled species was able to
grow the full length of the style on short styled species but not
viceversa. Despite these recent caveats, we still lack empirical
evidence to affirm what are the main traits that drive heterospecific
pollen effect for both pollen donor and recipient at seed production
level. Interestingly, to comprehend how these traits interact is also
crucial to look at the phylogenetic relatedness of the species. There is
a considerable amount of literature of crosses between close related
species Brown and Mitchell (2001) Arceo-Gómez et al. (2016) Tong and
Huang (2016) but few works focused on heterospecific pollen of far
related species Thomson et al. (1982) Galen and Gregory (1989) Neiland
and Wilcock (1999) which also show a noteworthy fitness decrease.
Although the effect of close related species is predicted to be greater
Ashman and Arceo-Gómez (2013) the presence of pollen of non related
species on multiple species Arceo-Gómez and Ashman (2016) and the higher
chances to coexist with a species that has less niche overlap (Ref) make
foreign pollen from far related species also an important subject of
study in order to understand the importance of heterospecific pollen in
natural systems. Notwithstanding, the effect of heterospecific pollen of
far and close related species at community level remains to be explored
beyond single pairwise interactions.

\textbf{Paragraph 3} Expanding ideas with examples

Interestingly, incompatibility system seems to play an important role in
foreign pollen effect where species that are self incompatible would
have stronger barriers towards heterospecific pollen than self
compatible species Ashman and Arceo-Gómez (2013). The type of
incompatibility, sporophytic or gametophytic is related with the place
of pollen recognition where the former take place at the sitgma level
and the latter occurs within the style, this last late acting pollen
recognition mechanism is associated with greater negative effect Barrett
(1988). Remarkably, there is a great variability in mating systems
across populations Whitehead et al. (2018) and therefore predict an
effect of foreign pollen is a bit obscured by the variability within
species, however species that are strong selfers or strong outcrossers
have less variablity in mating systems and predictions of effect could
be more realistic (see figure 1 from Whitehead et al. (2018)). Moreover,
other traits such as number of pollen grains per flower and number of
ovules have been tradittionally associated with the type of
incompatibility system where species with higher pollen ovule ratios are
predicted to be xenogamous and species with low pollen ovule ratios
autogamous (REF). Selfer species would have a reduction of herkogamy
(REF) and less pollen production per ovule (REF) which can be
interpretated as a reduction of pollen expoorted into the community.
Other morphological traits, like stigma size can be determinant for the
total pollen quatity that a stigma can receive and therefore related to
do that pollen size would also play an important role. Example with
pollen here.

\textbf{Paragraph 4} Introducing our experiment

The great environmental variability in natural systems and complexity of
floral structures make heterospecific pollination studies a daunting
task. Moreover, variation in sampling effort have been shown to be
determinant to characterize pollen transfer interactions Arceo-Gómez et
al. (2018). Although plant-pollinator network and pollen network studies
can give a first picture of the importance of foreign pollen is
necessary to address how its effect is shaped with both traits and
relatedness of the species. For this reason, in this study we have
created an artificial co-flowering community with 10 species belonging
to three different families with different traits where we try to test
the following questions: 1) Does heterospecific pollen reduce seed set,
if so, 2) Does heterospecific pollen effect depend on any floral trait?
3) Does heterospecific pollen effect depend on the relatedness of the
species.

\section{METHODS}\label{methods}

The study was conducted in a glasshouse at University of New England
(Armidale, Australia) from November 2017 to March 2018. Rooms were
temperature controlled depending on the requirements of the species with
day and night temperature differences. The species selected (Table 1)
belonged to three different families, Solanaceae, Brassicaceae and
Convolvulaceae. The criteria of species/family selection was based on
close/distant related species (see phylogenetic tree for relatedness fig
1), heterogeneous traits, low structural flower complexity and fast life
cycle. For the purpose of the experiment all the species where
considered as pollen recipient and as pollen donor (see interaction
matrix, fig 2). Species were watered once or twice per day and
fertilized weekly (NPK 23: 3.95: 14).

\textbf{Hand-pollination}

Foreign pollen effect was studied through two different treatments, one
with 50\% conspecific pollen and 50\% heterospecific pollen and a second
one with 100\% foreign pollen (N=10). Therefore, 180 different
combinations were perform with N=10. Seed set was the proxy of effect
for all our treatments. Moreover, hand cross pollination, hand self
pollination, apomixis (bagged emasculated flowers) and natural selfing
were tested for each species (N=10). Flowers were emasculated the day
prior anthesis and hand pollinated next day with a toothpick.
Hand-pollination was conducted with 3-4 gentle touches on the stigma
surface. The mixes of pollen were realized on an eppendorf based on the
pollen counts maded with Neubaeur chamber (each anther was counted 4
times for 20 different anthers per species). In order to confirm that
the treatments applied were 50-50 percent pollen, for each focal species
the total stigmatic load of pollen was counted from one donor of each
family (N=3).

\textbf{Traits and evolutive distance}

The traits measured for each species were pollen per anther, number of
ovules, stigma width and length and stigmatic area, style width and
length, ovary width and length. Moreover stigma type was tested. Pollen
was counted for 20 anthers of each species with 4 replicates per sample
with an hemocytometer. Previously anthers were squashed on a known
solution with the pippete tip and homogeneize with a vortex for 30
seconds. Ovule number was counted with the help of an stereomicroscope
and a small grid over a petri dish from 15 randomly selected flowers.
The different morphometrical traits were measured with a digital
stereomicrospe. Levels of self incompatibility were estimated by
dividing the the fruit set of hand self pollination by hand cross
pollination Lloyd and Schoen (1992).

\textbf{Analysis}

We used the statistical language \texttt{R} (R Core Team 2018) for all
our analyses. To test the effect of heterospecific pollen, we
substracted to the seed set of hand cross pollination the seed set of
heterospecific pollen treatments. Therefore, small values mean low
effect and viceversa. To be able to compare among species, seed set was
previosly scaled with mean 0 and standard deviation of 1. In order to
see correlations between hetereospecific pollen effect and traits we
performed Mantel test between the matrix of effect and the distance
matrix of each trait (euclidean distances). Moreover, Mantel test was
also conducted between heterospecific pollen effect and the square root
of the matrix of phylogenetic distance due to improvement in the
statistical power (Letten \& Cornwell 2014). We explored also the the
relations between traits and heterospecific pollen effect through
generalized mixed models where the response variable was heterospecific
pollen effect, the independent variable the different traits and the
random effects the different treatments per species. Moreover, pairwise
evolutive distances were calculated with MEGA7 for two kinds of markers:
1) Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 2) ribulose-bisphosphate
carboxylase (RBCL). The sequences of interest were downloaded from NCBI
GenBank and the phylogenetic tree constructed by maximum likelihood with
MEGA7.

\section{RESULTS}\label{results}

Results of hand cross pollination, self hand pollination, natural
selfing and apomixis are presented in table 2. Heterospecific pollen
reduced seet set signifcatively with the 50-50\% heterospecific pollen
treatments for 65\% of the pairwise interactions p\textless{}0.05.
Across families we found a very similar effect but when species where
look at species level they respond differently even within the same
family, for instance for two species of the Brassicaceae family
\emph{Brassica oleracea} and \emph{Eruca versicaria} we found very
contrasting effects of foreign pollen where for the first one, all
donors reduce seed set significatively and for the second, just two
species did out of nine. The 100\% foreign pollen treatments barely
produced seeds or fruits and just for \emph{Sinapis alba} we did not
find significant differences between the hand cross pollination and one
treatment with pollen from a confamilial. Solanaceae species with berry
fruit type developed small fruits or even normal fruits in some cases.
\emph{S. lycopersicum} seems to produced small fruits (35\% of the
treatments) independently of pollen and pollen donor due to also
apomictic treatments did, never normal size. \emph{C. annum} produced
some fruits (9\%) of both small and normal size and finally \emph{S.
melongena} produced seedless normal fruits with just confamilial pollen
(3\%), for both species seems that fruit formation was induced by pollen
on the stigma because of no production of fruit in apomictic treatments.
