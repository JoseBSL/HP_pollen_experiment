The 50% percent pollen treatments appear as species code "seed_set_final" and the 100% pollen treatments as species code "seed_set_100".

The trait data is organized in separate files for each trait. On the supplementary material of this article we have provided a table with the mean value of the different traits. Sample size and data collection information can be seen in the methods section of the main text.
